# 🧠 Intelligent Auto-Suggestion System (Offline Search Recommender)

This project is a **smart offline auto-suggestion system**, built using core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** without using any external AI or ML libraries.

It mimics real-time search suggestions like Google, YouTube, or VS Code. All suggestions are generated from a local `dictionary.txt` file using efficient algorithms and data structures.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔎 Auto-suggestions for words/phrases based on prefix
- ⚡ Fast lookups using **Trie (Prefix Tree)**
- 📊 Ranked results using **word frequency** with a **Hash Map**
- 📋 Top results selected using **sorting or a max-priority queue**
- ✅ Fully offline and **no internet needed**
- 🧼 Case-insensitive, punctuation-free, clean matching
- 🧪 CLI testing and unit test support

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- ✅ Language: **Node.js (JavaScript)**
- 📦 Dependencies: None
- 📁 Data Source: `dictionary.txt` (word and frequency list)

└── README.md           # Project documentation

```

## 📦 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Load dictionary
Reads from `data/dictionary.txt`, which has words and their frequency.

Example:
```

apple 30
application 15
apply 10
appetite 5
appletree 20

````

### 2️⃣ Build Trie
All words are inserted into a **Trie** with frequencies.

### 3️⃣ Search with prefix
When the user types a prefix (like `app`), the system:

- Navigates the Trie to the last character node
- Performs DFS to collect all words starting with that prefix
- Sorts by frequency (highest first)
- Returns top 5 suggestions

---

## 🔧 How to Use

### 💻 Run the project (CLI)

1. Open your terminal  
2. Go to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd intelligent-auto-suggester
````

3. Make sure you have Node.js installed
4. Run the app:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

### 📌 Example:

```
🔍 Enter your search prefix: app

✅ Suggestions:
1. apple (30)
2. appletree (20)
3. application (15)
4. apply (10)
5. appetite (5)
```

## 🧪 Test Cases

To verify functionality, run:

```bash
node test.js
```

This file runs a set of preloaded words and prints matching suggestions.

## 🧠 Data Structures Used

| DSA Used    | Purpose                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Trie        | Fast prefix search (O(length))   |
| DFS         | Collecting words from Trie       |
| Hash Map    | Tracking word frequencies        |
| Sort / Heap | Sorting suggestions by frequency |

---

## ⚙️ Time & Space Complexity

| Operation       | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Insert Word     | O(n)            | O(n\*k)          |
| Search Prefix   | O(n)            | O(n)             |
| DFS Suggestions | O(k log k)      | O(k)             |

* `n`: length of input prefix
* `k`: number of matching words

---

## ⚠️ Edge Cases Handled

* Empty input
* Prefix too short (`< 2` characters)
* No match found
* Case-insensitivity (e.g., `App` = `app`)
* Punctuation stripping (e.g., `app!` = `app`)

---

## ✅ Sample Dictionary

```
apple 30
application 15
apply 10
appetite 5
appletree 20
banana 12
book 20
bookmark 7
build 13
builder 4
```

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

* Implement Tries and understand prefix trees
* Use Hash Maps and Sorting/Priority Queues
* Handle real-time string processing
* Learn file handling and CLI building in Node.js
* Simulate AI-like search with DSA alone
